Rumen: Dimo.
Dimo: Hello, Rumen.
Rumen: Stoyan and his wife left Peshtera today. Last ones.
Dimo: And their kids?
Rumen: Police are looking, but it's been 10 days.
Dimo: Hm.
Rumen: Levnik is dead, and now so is Peshtera. Let's leave together, Dimo.
Rumen: Come with me, to Plovdiv. I have work. Food service. Tourist stuff for rich Turks.
Dimo: They'll pay you if you bring someone else?
