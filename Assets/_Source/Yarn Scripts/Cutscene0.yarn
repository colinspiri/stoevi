Rumen: Dimo, my friend! // trying to establish friendly rapport
Dimo: Rumen. // implying the conversation will be transactional
Rumen: Where's Petrov? // asking innocently even though he can figure it out, just wants to talk about it with Dimo
<<theme 1>>
Dimo: Left with his wife two days ago. // giving the information, not wanting to be too talkative
Rumen: So, last man standing, huh? // trying to turn it into a joke
Dimo: Mhm. // Dimo doesn't think it's funny
Dimo: How much for 4 seeds? // but is here to do business
Rumen: 60 levs. When are you leaving this place? // answers Dimo, but also wants to keep talking about it
<<theme 2>>
Dimo: I have no plans to leave. Is 50 okay? // shuts Rumen down, but also asks for a favor
Rumen: You make me hike all the way out to Levnik for 50 levs? // exaggerating the difference because he's greedy, also noting how isolated Dimo is now
Rumen: This place is dead, Dimo. It's not the place we grew up in anymore. // trying to appeal to their childhood friendship
Dimo: Fine, 60. See you tomorrow. // Dimo isn't swayed because he doesn't respect Rumen or think of them as friends
<<theme 3>>
Rumen: Sure, then. // passive-aggressive
Rumen: Good luck with your harvest. // but still trying to maintain a relationship
