Rumen: Dimo, it's dangerous here. Come with me to Plovdiv.
Rumen: I have work. Food service. Tourist stuff for rich Turks.
Dimo: And you get extra pay if you bring me?
Rumen: I'm worried about you. An old man, living alone.
Dimo: I am not alone. 
Rumen: What would Ana want?
<<theme 3>>
Dimo: You know nothing about my children.
Rumen: I'm leaving in a week. Just consider it.
